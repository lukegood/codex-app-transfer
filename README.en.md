Codex App Transfer is a lightweight desktop config + forwarding tool for the **OpenAI Codex App**. It runs a local gateway that translates Codex App's Responses API requests (HTTP streaming / non-streaming + `/responses`) into Chat Completions and other upstream formats, then forwards them to your chosen provider. The desktop UI manages providers, model mappings, the forwarding port, and the logs panel, letting Codex App talk to any third-party chat/completions inference service.

After starting forwarding, Codex App talks to this tool at `127.0.0.1:18080`. Closing the window minimizes the app to the system tray; right-click the tray icon and choose "Exit" to fully quit.

Current version **v2.3.4** (see [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and [Releases](https://github.com/Cmochance/codex-app-transfer/releases)).

### Codex App in action

With any provider enabled, Codex App's model picker shows `<provider> / <real-model>`-style real model names. Tool loops / `previous_response_id` history replay / thinking-mode reasoning_content injection are all handled transparently by the local proxy:

### Codex Desktop background themes (optional)

Inject background image + frosted-glass panel CSS into Codex Desktop (the Electron client). Five built-in anime themes plus user upload. The Codex binary is not modified — runtime injection via Chromium DevTools Protocol. The toggle is a persistent preference marker: enabling it persists the setting and injects immediately (best-effort); if Codex wasn't launched via this tool (or its debug port is unavailable), a confirm dialog offers to restart Codex so the theme takes effect. Disabling it clears the saved preference and best-effort live-removes the injected theme via CDP (back to native UI), symmetric with enabling — likewise, if the debug port is unavailable the removal fails and the theme stays until the next Codex restart.

A sixth theme (Carton) carries a floating mascot in the bottom-right that reacts to the cursor. **Custom backgrounds**: Theme page → "+ Add custom" → pick a JPG/PNG → 16:9 crop modal (drag + scroll to zoom) → apply. If the toggle is on at Codex launch, the selected theme auto-injects — no manual step needed.

### Usage panel inside Codex (optional)

Injects a standalone "Usage" section at the bottom of Codex Desktop's "Toggle pinned summary" popup: 5-hour / weekly quota bars (whitelisted providers: antigravity gemini series + GLM Coding Plan + Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan), balance / usage numeric entries (DeepSeek / Kimi Moonshot / anyrouter), context usage, real-time token rate + cumulative total, and cache hit rate. The **Context** row expands into a Claude-style by-source breakdown dropdown (classified by what is sent upstream: tool calls & output / reasoning / developer instructions / conversation messages / tool definitions / system prompt), persisted per conversation for instant load. See "What it does" below.

![Usage panel inside Codex](img/codex-usage-breakdown.jpg)

## What it does

- Manage multiple providers; map OpenAI model names (`gpt-5.5` / `gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.4-mini` / `gpt-5.3-codex` / `gpt-5.2`) to the provider's real model IDs
- Translate Codex App's Responses API streaming / non-streaming requests into upstream protocols: Chat Completions, Gemini Native (`:streamGenerateContent`), Gemini CLI OAuth (Cloud Code Assist), Anthropic Messages (`/v1/messages`), Grok Web (`/rest/app-chat/conversations/new`), Responses passthrough, etc.
- Multi-turn tool conversation context + `previous_response_id` history replay + autocompact expansion + thinking / reasoning_content injection — all aligned with the OpenAI Responses API protocol; remote compact supported on both protocol generations: the legacy `/responses/compact` endpoint plus remote compaction v2 (a regular streaming `/responses` request carrying a `compaction_trigger` marker, answered with an SSE stream containing a single compaction item) — newer Codex builds previously failed autocompact with `expected exactly one compaction output item`, now fixed (MOC-198)
- Reasoning (thinking) blocks now display correctly in Codex Desktop v26.608+: the new renderer reads the reasoning **content channel** (`reasoning_text` + `content_index`) instead of the old summary channel; gemini_native and chat paths now dual-emit both channels for compatibility with both old and new Codex versions. Chat path also fixes interleaving of reasoning and tool_call stream events (reasoning is closed before opening a new tool item); gemini path fixes tool-call grouping (`functionCall`-following empty text parts no longer produce a blank message item, so same-turn tools fold correctly) (MOC-203)
- Codex App's freeform `apply_patch` tool (edit-file +/- diff UI) works on chat-completions providers: the adapter bridges Responses `custom_tool_call` ↔ chat `function_call` wire forms, the model emits V4A-format patches, Codex App renders the diff (issue #235); Gemini-family providers (gemini_native + Cloud Code Assist / Antigravity, using generateContent) now have the same bridge via MOC-75: on the request side, freeform `custom` tools are downgraded to a function with an `input` string parameter (V4A description reuses the chat constants); on the response side, Gemini's `functionCall` is repacked into a `custom_tool_call` wire
- **apply_patch middle layer (format recovery)**: third-party chat models lack GPT's lark-grammar-constrained generation, so they often emit malformed V4A (double-sided `@@`, missing `+` on Add File lines, byte-mismatched context, missing `*** Begin/End Patch` envelope, dropped blank lines, missing line prefixes, **multiple discontiguous hunks dropping the `@@` separator**, etc.). The middle layer recovers each known error to valid format before sending to Codex — reading the file from disk to align `@@` anchors / context to real bytes, restoring dropped blank lines, converting empty-file / rename-only into `Delete+Add`, **auto-segmenting a multi-region edit that omits `@@` by the hunks' real file positions and inserting bare `@@`** (MOC-263 P0: only when uniquely segmentable; ambiguous floating `+` placement passes through), etc.; **non-destructive** (never loses content or overwrites) and **passes unknown cases through untouched** (let Codex error so the model self-corrects, never guesses). The disk-read cwd is resolved from **the most recent few cwd candidates** rather than a single global value, so the fallback no longer breaks under concurrent multi-session traffic where another project's cwd would clobber it (MOC-263 P1). For the common case where the model mis-prefixes the terminator (`+*** End Patch`, a slip when `+`-prefixing every Add File line) and leaves a stray `*** End Patch` line in the created file: the root fix is in the injected guidance (teach the model not to prefix the terminator); the middle layer, on encountering such a prefixed terminator, disambiguates by file type — for code / structured-config files (where a bare `*** End Patch` line can never be valid source) it strips the prefix to a bare terminator; for doc / text / unknown types, where that line could legitimately be real last-line content, it does NOT guess (neither strips, which could delete content, nor appends, which would leave residue) and leaves the patch incomplete so the model re-issues per the guidance. The chat-path apply_patch guidance is optimized alongside (context lines must already exist / don't re-delete already-removed lines in sequential edits / dedicated guidance for memory files) (MOC-268). It mirrors the V4A lark grammar Codex constrains GPT with, enforced post-hoc on the chat path (credit to [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)'s apply_patch lark grammar) (MOC-194 / MOC-263 / MOC-268)
- **Native image generation on Antigravity (MOC-210)**: Codex's built-in `image_gen` tool now actually generates images on the Antigravity provider (native, not the CLI fallback). When the model calls `image_gen` mid-conversation, the proxy intercepts the call in the Gemini response stream, issues an image sub-request (defaults to `gemini-3.1-flash-image`, overridable via the `gpt-image-1` model slot in the provider config), and inlines the returned image as an `image_generation_call` back to Codex for rendering; text/reasoning still stream live, and the image turn is recorded in history to avoid duplicate generations. The tool is exposed only to Antigravity (other providers have no image backend).
- When Gemini-family providers (gemini_native + Cloud Code Assist / Antigravity) return an upstream 4xx/5xx, the proxy translates it into a Codex-recognizable `response.failed` whose `error.code` is aligned to Codex's retry whitelist: **unambiguously-permanent** errors (400 INVALID_ARGUMENT / 401 auth / 403 permission) surface to the user and stop immediately (so you can switch models), instead of Codex re-sending the same request and deadlocking; **transient-or-uncertain** errors (timeout / rate-limit / quota / 5xx) keep retry semantics (exponential backoff; truly-unrecoverable ones surface after the retry cap) (MOC-79)
- Grok Web upstream 4xx/5xx are now similarly aligned to Codex's retry whitelist: 401 auth / 403 permission → `invalid_prompt` (permanent, Codex surfaces and stops), no longer deadlocking on repeated retries; transient errors (timeout / rate_limited / server_error) keep retry semantics (MOC-90)
- Chat-completions-compatible providers (DeepSeek / Kimi / MiMo / GLM / Aliyun Bailian / MiniMax, etc.) now receive the same treatment: previously the proxy forwarded upstream HTTP error status + JSON error body as-is, leaving Codex App stuck in "Thinking" indefinitely (no error shown, no retry, conversation blocked). The response is now rewritten into a well-formed `response.failed` stream — 400 bad request / 401 auth / 403 permission → `invalid_prompt` (permanent, surfaces and stops); 429 transient (per-minute) rate-limit / 5xx / timeout keep retry semantics; **429 quota / usage-window exhaustion** (conservative strong-signal detection, e.g. GLM "usage limit reached for the N-hour window, resets at …") is treated as permanent → fail-fast, surfacing the upstream quota message (with reset time) and stopping instead of endlessly "Reconnecting" (also eliminating the reconnect-triggered "proxy adapter error" noise) — sharing the `codex_retry_code` whitelist with grok and gemini paths (MOC-103 / MOC-264)
- **Two-layer session history persistence**: L1 in-memory LRU + L2 sqlite (`~/.codex-app-transfer/sessions.db`), preserving history across `.app` restarts. L2 uses sha256 **content-addressed deduplication** (images externalized to blob sidecars + full message deduplication, shared snapshots stored only once — measured ~97% message body reduction), keeping the store tiny and enabling **no-expiry persistence** (the old 30-day TTL has been removed; old conversations stay resumable forever); legacy pre-MOC-142/168 rows are silently migrated in the background on first launch (MOC-142 / MOC-168 / MOC-170)
- **Import / restore isolated sessions left by other tools (CAT-255)**: Codex Desktop filters its conversation list by the active `model_provider`. Tools like cc-switch write a third-party `model_provider` into `config.toml`, so the sessions they left behind are hidden under transfer's view (this project deliberately never writes `model_provider`, anchoring on `openai` to stay interoperable with the official app). Settings → Advanced → Session history adds **Import** (re-tags third-party sessions to `openai` in place so they reappear in transfer) and **Restore** (writes a chosen third-party `model_provider` back onto selected sessions so the corresponding tool can see them again — the inverse of import); transfer also prompts to import on startup when it detects isolated sessions. Both must close Codex first (they write Codex's exclusive session-state DB `state_<N>.sqlite`), then auto close → rewrite in place → restart Codex
- **Wire-level dedup of repeated system blocks (MOC-193)**: Codex sends a full env block (~37 KB) with every turn; long conversations accumulate multiple identical system/developer instruction messages. The conversion pipeline automatically deduplicates identical blocks after history merge and before forwarding upstream (keeping the first occurrence to preserve the prompt-cache prefix), covering all four paths (chat / gemini / anthropic / grok) and saving tens of KB per turn in long sessions; the session cache is kept intact
- **Usage stats** (Sidebar → Usage): parses `~/.codex/sessions/` rollout JSONL, aggregating token usage by conversation / day / model (parser vendored from ryoppippi/ccusage). The by-conversation view shows each conversation's **cache hit rate**; clicking the number opens a **per-prompt hit-rate histogram** (cached contained within total, two-tone; hover for cached / total input / output). The proxy locally records `session → real upstream model` (for conversations run after this version), so the by-conversation model column shows the real upstream model instead of Codex's client placeholder (`gpt-5.x`)
- **Real ChatGPT account Plugins unlock** (relay mode, v2.2.0): unlock Codex Plugins with a real account instead of a CDP-spoofed login — invoke official `codex login` in-app (account switching is unified under the three-mode plugin-unlock selector below, MOC-257). Relay keeps `auth_mode=chatgpt` + tokens so Codex shows the Plugins entry **natively**, removing the CDP-spoof startup latency; third-party models go through the proxy via `openai_base_url`, while account / plugin backend requests pass through to the real chatgpt.com via `chatgpt_base_url`. Transfer **never** refreshes the single-use refresh token (double-refreshing alongside the local Codex would trip `refresh_token_reused` and burn the account); refresh belongs to the source only (local Codex self-refreshes / `codex login` fetches fresh). Paired **system-proxy reachability check**: a "Network Proxy" dashboard card + an unlock gate (unlocks only when the account is valid AND the system proxy is reachable, otherwise guides you to start the proxy / log in / force-enable); the probe only connects to the proxy port and never touches chatgpt.com. Also: under relay, transfer doesn't refresh the token (relying on the source to keep it fresh), but a server-side revocation (double-refresh burn / re-login elsewhere) is invisible to the local JWT `exp` → previously the UI would **falsely show the account as fine** because the local token hadn't expired; now the proxy passthrough detects a chatgpt-backend **401** and writes back a "re-login required" state so the UI prompts re-login promptly (MOC-104 / MOC-114 / MOC-124)
- **Codex plugin-unlock three modes** (MOC-257): an Off / Synthetic / Real selector in Settings that unifies and replaces the old CDP injection (which only changed the renderer UI while `auth.json` stayed apikey → an inconsistent transport where plugins didn't actually work). **Synthetic**: with no real ChatGPT account, write a well-formed synthetic `auth.json` (`auth_mode=chatgpt` + a synthetic JWT with a far-future `exp` to keep the CLI from refreshing, plus a `cas_synthetic` sentinel) so Codex shows Plugins **natively**; the proxy **fabricates 200 responses** for the `/backend-api/*` account/plugin requests (**never 401**, which would trigger Codex re-login), while conversations still go through your third-party provider (the resolver only validates the JWT shape, not the signature). **Real**: relay the machine's ChatGPT login through to the real chatgpt.com; an unusable account (expired / server-revoked) **auto-degrades to synthetic** (and auto-upgrades back once usable again), and with no account a dialog guides you through `codex login`. **Off**: move the real account out to a backup and ensure `~/.codex` has no `auth.json`, restoring the original config on exit (real-account tokens stay intact across every switch)
- **Plugin marketplace + Plugins enhancements (MOC-7)**: browse a mirror of OpenAI Codex's plugin directory by category under `Docs → MCP → Marketplace` (178 connectors + search + icons + website links); data comes from a project-maintained public storage repo (`codex-app-transfer-storage`; the backend fetches the registry over `raw.githubusercontent.com`, proxies icons + caches); **multi-source aggregation** — an official source plus your own public connector registries via "Add source" (same `{connectors}` schema). **Browse-only**: these are OpenAI-platform OAuth remote connectors brokered by a single `plugin-runtime` MCP server (`chatgpt.com/backend-api/ps/mcp`) with no standalone MCP endpoint, so the mirror holds display data only. Also: `Docs → MCP → Plugins` now shows an icon (read from the manifest `interface.logo`) per installed plugin + a "Skills" button (popup shows its `SKILL.md`; a dropdown picks one when a plugin has multiple skills)
- **Codex remote-control WS passthrough** (relay mode, MOC-125): Codex desktop "remote control" (Mobile→Mac) opens a **WebSocket** handshake at `wham/remote/control/server`; under relay, transfer previously forwarded it as plain HTTP without a WS upgrade → chatgpt.com returned 404 → remote control never established and Codex `enroll`-looped forever. Now does **true WS passthrough**: the receiving side accepts Codex's WS upgrade via axum, the upstream side opens a dedicated `http1_only` client (WS upgrade needs HTTP/1.1, whereas `state.http` ALPN-negotiates h2) to `wss://chatgpt.com`, injects Codex's `x-codex-installation-id` / `x-codex-server-id` / `authorization` and other remote-control-required headers, then bidirectionally pumps frames. The normal-forward `state.http` (reqwest 0.12) is left completely untouched — the WS path uses a separate reqwest 0.13 client, so existing upstream CF/ClientHello fingerprints don't change at all
- Codex App config guardrails: snapshots `~/.codex/{config.toml,auth.json}` before apply; restores via per-key smart merge on exit / next start; **force-kill self-heal**: if transfer is killed (kill -9 / crash) before it can restore, the next launch detects the previous session's leftover snapshot and replays the missed restore (previously this left `sandbox_mode` / a dead-proxy `openai_base_url` behind, making GPT-account Codex report "couldn't set up the admin sandbox" and fail to chat); snapshots also filter residual signature fields at capture time so polluted configs never harden into the restore baseline; **Portable MCP auth vault** (on by default): switches MCP OAuth credential storage to a portable file (`~/.codex/.credentials.json`, mode 0o600) and keeps a mirror outside `~/.codex` (`~/.codex-app-transfer/mcp-credentials.json`); when the whole file is wiped by an account switch / accidental delete / new machine, the next launch pops a dialog listing **each** recoverable MCP authorization to restore / remove / ignore individually (multi-select + select-all / restore-all / remove-all / ignore-all; un-handled and ignored entries persist and keep prompting on the next launch — backups are **never silently dropped**; a Settings entry + pending status are also provided); an intentional per-server logout is respected, never resurrected; note: does not fix natural OAuth expiry; also provides an **original-config integrity check** in Settings: scans `~/.codex/config.toml` and historical snapshots for fields written by transfer apply (`model_catalog_json` / `openai_base_url`, etc.), with **Show residual fields** (read-only listing of each file's residual fields to be cleaned) and **Targeted cleanup** (precisely strips them while preserving model / personality / `[projects.*]` / mcp_servers and other config)
- **Codex Doc Management** (Sidebar → Codex) — Agents / Memories / Skills documents pop a confirmation before Apply writes to disk, guarding against accidental edits to AI-behavior-affecting docs (MOC-106):
  - **Agents**: raw read/write for non-sensitive `AGENTS.md` paths under HOME with file system picker; system and credential directories are rejected, with project-root / subdir chip labels from `.git/` detection
  - **Memories**: fixed entries `~/.codex/memories/MEMORY.md` (main index) + `memory_summary.md` (auto summary), plus non-sensitive project `MEMORY.md` paths under HOME; system and credential directories are rejected
  - **Skills**: scan `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for raw editing and keep hash resolution inside the skills root; "Open folder" button shells out to `open` so users edit non-SKILL.md companion files (scripts / examples / templates) in Finder/Explorer
  - **MCP**: structured JSON editing on the `[mcp_servers.*]` section of `~/.codex/config.toml` (`toml_edit` round-trip preserves comments + sibling config sections); Plugins sub-tab scans `~/.codex/plugins/cache/` for installed bundles (enable toggle / uninstall); all writes are atomic + independent history per SHA-256 path hash (no cross-tab interference); **adding / editing / one-click-installing a server, and overwriting via raw TOML, always pop a confirmation before the write** (stdio shows the command that will run on your machine with your account's permissions, http shows the connection address) — guards against typos, with no skip-confirmation whitelist (MOC-106)
- Real-time logs panel auto-refreshing every 2s; unified `tracing::warn!(error_id, detail)` with stable tokens — operators can grep / aggregate
- Feedback dialog automatically attaches diagnostic material (environment info, sanitized config, recent error snapshot with full request / response) — fewer back-and-forth follow-ups
- Chinese / English UI; light / dark / green / orange / gray / white themes
- **Injected system prompts follow the UI language**: the `apply_patch` chat-path rules + autocompact summarization prompt that this project injects for non-OpenAI providers track the `语言 / Language` setting (Chinese users → Chinese prompts, avoiding mixed-language model thinking); V4A keywords (`*** Begin Patch` / `@@ <header>` etc.) + Codex CLI error message originals stay in English (parser / matcher does not accept translations)
- **Codex Desktop Theme (optional, off by default)**: Theme page ships 11 built-in anime themes (`carton` with a floating mascot, plus `changli` / `azurlane` / `nailin` / `zani` / `frost` / `nocturne` / `duet` / `rose` / `sonata` / `studio`), each individually colour-matched to its artwork (per-theme glass + accent). Injects design-token overrides (`--color-token-*` + the runtime `--color-*` layer) + a background image into Codex Desktop via CDP, covering chat / settings / collapsed-sidebar / popovers. Toggle is independent from Plugin Unlock; page reload re-applies automatically; disabling the toggle clears the saved preference and best-effort live-removes the injected theme (back to native UI), only staying until the next Codex restart if removal fails (debug port unavailable)
- **Usage panel inside Codex Desktop (optional, off by default)** (MOC-204): Settings → "Show usage in Codex" injects a collapsible "Usage" section at the bottom of Codex's "Toggle pinned summary" popup (the panel that contains Environment / Sources sections), showing up to 4 rows: ① **5-hour quota / weekly quota** — whitelisted providers only: **antigravity gemini series** reads from `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuotaSummary` (dual-window 5h + weekly, remaining% = remainingFraction×100); **GLM Coding Plan** (`bigmodel.cn` / `z.ai` coding hosts) reads from `monitor/usage/quota/limit` (apiKey auth, no Bearer prefix), returning 5h + weekly TOKENS_LIMIT records, converted as remaining% = 100 − usage%; **Xiaomi MiMo Token Plan** (`platform.xiaomimimo.com`) shows a monthly-plan remaining% progress bar — the plan quota is only accessible via a MiMo web session (httpOnly cookie), so you must click "Sign in to Xiaomi account" in the provider edit page first: the app opens an embedded webview for login, captures the session cookie, and the daemon uses it to query `/api/v1/tokenPlan/usage`; **DeepSeek** (`api.deepseek.com`) shows a ¥X balance numeric entry, read from the official `/user/balance` endpoint using the same API key (Bearer); **Kimi (月之暗面 / Moonshot PAYG, `api.moonshot.cn` / `.ai`)** shows balance numeric entries (available / cash / voucher, ¥/$ by host), read from the official `/v1/users/me/balance` using the same key (Bearer) — **note: the subscription-based `kimi-code` (`api.kimi.com/coding`) is a separate provider with no balance endpoint and is excluded**; **anyrouter** (`api.anyrouter.top`) shows a $X used-amount numeric entry, read from `/v1/dashboard/billing/usage` using the same key (Bearer; remaining balance is blocked by upstream anti-scraping so only the used amount is shown). Whitelist is determined by baseUrl host. Red warning ≤10% + reset time shown. Quota rows appear only when the active provider matches a whitelisted host; all others show no quota rows. ② **Context** — injected JS reads `contextUsage.usedTokens` + `contextWindow` directly from Codex's React fiber, available immediately for any existing conversation without a new turn; full window = contextWindow ÷ 0.95 (adds back the 5% reserve Codex hides); 1M models display "1M" not "1000k". ③ **Tokens (real-time rate · cumulative)** — rate estimated by a MutationObserver watching Codex's streaming text (2s sliding window, CJK-aware); cumulative total from Codex rollout. ④ **Cache hit rate** — from rollout cached_input/input. **③④ and the rate are all isolated per active conversation (MOC-230)**: injected JS reads the current `conversationId` from the React fiber and the daemon keys totals to that conversation's rollout (== filename uuid, not the most-recently-modified file), following conversation switches; shows "—" (never another conversation's data) when the id / its rollout can't be resolved. The "Usage" title is collapsible (chevron + localStorage-persisted). Injection uses periodic CDP pushes; re-attaches automatically after a Codex page reload or restart. Requires launching Codex through this app; restart Codex after toggling if already running.
- **System-proxy (VPN/ladder) connectivity detection** (MOC-114): the dashboard "Network Proxy" card shows live status — connected / disconnected / PAC auto-config / detecting. In relay real-account mode, the "Auto-unlock Codex Plugins" toggle gates on both conditions being met (valid account AND proxy reachable), preventing the silent-failure state where plugins spin and return 502s while the UI shows "logged in" because the proxy is down. Detection uses a short-timeout TCP connect to the proxy port only; chatgpt.com is never contacted.
- **Built-in web fetch tool (web_fetch, MOC-144)**: Settings → "Built-in web fetch backend" — select `auto` (recommended; **defaults to `auto` since MOC-215, works out of the box**; **since MOC-256, a new install with no system Chrome / no downloaded shell defaults to `off`** to avoid a silent ~86 MB chrome-headless-shell download when web_fetch escalates to headless at runtime — new users with Chrome get web_fetch / web_search without manually enabling it, while users without Chrome confirm the download via the gate when they manually pick auto/headless; web_fetch uses curl/wreq and needs no Chrome, web_search is still gated on Chrome readiness and never silently downloads) / `curl` / `wreq` / `headless` (**independent of** the Codex sandbox network toggle). Transfer automatically registers a `web_fetch` MCP tool with Codex, which the model can call directly to fetch web pages — `curl` uses standard HTTP, `wreq` bypasses Cloudflare TLS challenges, `headless` drives a headless Chrome to retrieve JS-rendered DOM (selecting `headless` / `auto` in Settings first checks Chrome readiness: a system Chrome that passes the `--version` self-test, or an already-downloaded built-in chrome-headless-shell, enables it directly without re-downloading; otherwise it prompts to confirm downloading chrome-headless-shell, ~86 MB on demand. If a system proxy is configured but currently unreachable, it auto-downgrades to `wreq` with a notice). Beyond the three fetch backends, `web_fetch` also follows **HTML `meta refresh` / JS `location` redirects** (re-fetches the target URL, loop-protected to 3 hops) — curl/wreq/headless only follow HTTP 3xx and do not handle these client-side redirects; "placeholder" redirect pages (e.g. pages that bounce around Twitter/Substack blocks) are now automatically followed to the real destination (MOC-139). **`auto` tier (MOC-161)**: automatically escalates from curl → wreq → headless based on page-difficulty signals; remembers the last successful tier per origin so subsequent requests start there; downgrades to curl when no system proxy is reachable (wreq / headless rely on a proxy); first use of the headless tier still confirms the Chrome download. Switching tiers takes effect immediately (no restart needed); **toggling the feature on or off requires restarting Codex Desktop** for the network tools (web_fetch / web_search / read_url_local) to appear / disappear in Codex (since MOC-235 the MCP server stays registered to host `read_tool_artifact`; turning the network backend off just stops exposing those network tools rather than unloading the whole server). Fetched HTML is auto-converted to markdown before returning to the model (cleaner, fewer tokens; non-HTML responses pass through unchanged), and headless waits for networkIdle before capturing the rendered DOM (MOC-145). Headless fetches run with anti-detection stealth (strips `navigator.webdriver`, fakes `window.chrome`/plugins/WebGL, removes the `HeadlessChrome` UA token), passing passive-fingerprint / simple JS-challenge Cloudflare; interactive Turnstile/DataDome managed challenges still won't pass (MOC-152). On a CF JS-challenge page, headless now **waits in place for it to auto-clear** before reading (instead of returning the challenge page as content), and **persists the browser profile per origin** to reuse CF clearance cookies — a second fetch of the same site skips the repeat challenge and is faster (MOC-156). Before markdown conversion the page goes through **main-content extraction** (readability algorithm strips nav/header/footer/sidebar/ads, keeping only the article so large-page content is no longer crowded out by truncation; non-article pages fall back to the full page); **binary resources** (image / video / audio / PDF) and files over 16 MB are not downloaded and return a clear notice instead (no more garbage bytes / OOM) (MOC-152). `web_fetch` **returns the full extracted page text by default** (the current turn's tool output goes into the LLM context in full; the adapter layer automatically compresses older tool outputs to prevent context overflow; MOC-190) — no more pagination, no `offset` paging, no relevance-based `query` chunk selection, so precise content (code / schema / version numbers / figures) is never lost. If you fetched a URL earlier in the conversation and its content has since been folded/compressed in the context history, use **`read_url_local(url)`** to pull the full text from the in-process cache without re-fetching (cache TTL: 15 min). **More generally, when any tool's large output (shell / Feishu and other MCP / etc.) gets folded into a `[Tool output stored outside model context]` summary in history, the summary includes an `Artifact ID`, and the model can call `read_tool_artifact(artifact_id)` to retrieve that output's text** — read from the shared `tool_artifacts.db` (SQLite WAL, cross-process) that the proxy persists when compressing, so the model never re-runs a tool just to see history again; the retrieved content is visible only in the current turn and gets folded again next turn (no long-term context bloat); outputs over 90k chars are returned in pages (each below the proxy keep-full cap, with a trailer telling the model to page via `offset`) (MOC-235). These tools (`web_fetch` / `web_search` / `read_url_local` / `read_tool_artifact`) declare `readOnlyHint` (read-only), so Codex's auto-review guardian **skips approval** for them (`requires_mcp_tool_approval` short-circuits on the read-only hint) — network calls no longer incur a per-call risk-approval round-trip, removing that latency (MOC-172).
- **Built-in web search tool (web_search, MOC-12)**: when the built-in web fetch backend is on (non-off) and the machine has Chrome ready, transfer registers a `web_search` tool with Codex — the model passes a query string and gets back a structured list of results (title + real URL + snippet), forming a **two-step search**: `web_search` to find sources, then `web_fetch` to read content, eliminating the need to guess URLs. **Why this matters**: Codex sends an OpenAI server-side `web_search` tool each turn, but third-party chat providers (MiniMax / DeepSeek / GLM / Kimi, etc.) don't support it — the adapter drops it, leaving the model to scrape search engines or guess URLs (real-world success rate ~17%). This tool queries **DuckDuckGo + Bing in parallel and merges the results, deduped by normalized URL** (no API key required, data-centre / VPN-exit IP friendly; the two indexes complement each other so single-call coverage is noticeably broader than a single source, MOC-215; previously Bing was only a fallback when DDG failed, MOC-186), and **always uses headless** internally — DDG / Bing block plain HTTP with anti-bot challenges regardless of TLS fingerprint, so a real browser is required; the parallel fetch keeps wall-time ≈ the slower single engine rather than the sum, and either engine being blocked / empty still leaves the other usable. `web_search` always uses headless internally, but its **exposure / invocation only requires Chrome to be ready** (system Chrome / Edge / Chromium, or an already-downloaded built-in chrome-headless-shell) — decoupled from the web_fetch tier: users with system Chrome can use search under any non-off tier (incl. curl / wreq) without triggering a download; if neither is present it stays hidden and a call returns a hint to pick the headless tier to complete the first-time download (MOC-190). Ad results are filtered out; blocked / no-results states return explicit error messages (never silently empty). **Pagination (MOC-215)**: `web_search` returns only the first page (~10-20 results, not fetching multiple pages at once to avoid excessive headless latency); when the model needs more / different sources it uses the separate **`web_search_more`** tool (same query, `page=2/3…`) to fetch the next batch (via Bing's `first=` deep pages), with a tail hint in the result steering the model to paginate rather than re-run the same query — numeric string arguments are parsed leniently (models often send `page` as the string `"2"`) so pagination never silently falls back to page 1. DDG HTML parsing borrows from `duckduckgo_search` (Python).

Windows builds are not Authenticode-signed yet, so Windows may show an "unknown publisher" warning — use the `.sha256` / `.sig` to verify download integrity.

macOS builds are **not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID** and **not yet Notarized** (release bundles are ad-hoc signed), so Gatekeeper blocks first launch. How to allow (since macOS 15 Sequoia / 26 Tahoe, Apple removed the `right-click → Open` bypass — use the steps below): drag the .app from the dmg into `Applications`, double-click once so the blocking dialog appears and dismiss it, then click "Open Anyway" at the bottom of `System Settings → Privacy & Security`; or verify download integrity with `.sha256` / `.sig` and run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Codex App Transfer.app"` in Terminal to clear the quarantine attribute. On macOS 14 and earlier, `right-click → Open` still works as a one-time allow.

## Quick Start

1. Launch Codex App Transfer; the desktop window opens
2. On the dashboard, click the top-right "+" → pick a preset or add a custom provider; fill in API Base URL, API Key, then "Fetch models" and add model mappings
3. Click the **Apply** button at the bottom — config is written and a toast confirms sync (if a provider is already configured, just click **Apply** on its card on the home page)
4. To make Codex Desktop pick up the new config, click the ↻ **Restart Codex** button at the top-right (decoupled from Apply since #281 to avoid losing in-flight context on misclicks)

> **MCP tools (Codex 0.130+ `tool_search` mechanism)**: Codex 0.130+ defers server-side MCP tools (`mcp__notion__*` / `mcp__linear__*`, etc., plus the built-in `cat-webfetch` web_fetch / web_search) to `tool_search` instead of placing them directly in `tools[]`. The proxy wires the full chain on both the **chat path** and the **Gemini / Antigravity path** — discovering tools from `tool_search_output` → injecting them into the downstream `tools[]` / `functionDeclarations` → routing back upstream by `namespace` (chat #293; Gemini/Antigravity MOC-217). **Applies to all chat-compat + Gemini-family providers in the table above**; only the Responses passthrough row (last row, routes through the proxy but as a 1:1 passthrough — namespace bundles are not flattened) is excluded. Previously the Gemini / Antigravity path dropped `tool_search`, leaving all deferred MCP tools (including the built-in web_fetch / web_search) invisible to the model under those providers — fixed by MOC-217.

## Reasoning effort mapping (chat-compat `reasoning_effort`)

How Codex's `low/medium/high/xhigh` is dispatched per chat-completions upstream (issue #254):

| Provider | `xhigh` / `max` | Other tiers | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DeepSeek V4** | `reasoning_effort: "max"` | `low/medium/high` → `"high"` | Only chat upstream that accepts a true max tier |
| **Kimi / Kimi Code / GLM / Bailian Qwen / Xiaomi MiMo / MiniMax** | field dropped | field dropped | Upstreams don't accept `reasoning_effort`; default thinking applies. Set provider-native fields in `requestOptions` to control explicitly |
| **Custom chat-compat** | clamp to `"high"` | passthrough | OpenAI standard enum conservative fallback |

**Native reasoning tiers per provider (MOC-241)**: GLM thinking models (the GLM-4.5+/5.x series that Z.AI documents as supporting `thinking`; legacy `glm-4-*` lack it and keep the default four) present Codex's native `none` (no thinking) + `max` reasoning options in the model picker — matching GLM's binary thinking switch (no `low/medium/high` depth tiers) — instead of the generic four. Selecting `none` disables GLM thinking by emitting both native disable wires — top-level `thinking:{type:disabled}` (hosted Z.AI / BigModel, per docs.bigmodel.cn) and `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking:false` (self-hosted vLLM/SGLang, the wire used by GLM's official client Zhipu ZCode) — both mean "disable", so they don't conflict and cover either deployment; `max` uses GLM's default (thinking on). The top-level `reasoning_effort` field is still dropped (per the row above — GLM doesn't accept it). Tier labels use Codex's own localized strings (no custom injection). **The same `reasoning_tiers` table also covers**: DeepSeek V4 (`none/high/max`; none disables, high/max via `reasoning_effort`), Kimi K2 / Aliyun Bailian Qwen 3.x / Xiaomi MiMo v2.x / MiniMax-M3 (all `none/max`), and **MiniMax-M2.x (forced thinking) plus all Gemini models (AI Studio / CLI / Antigravity, gemini_native) → a single `max` tier** (the picker shows one fixed "Max" with no switchable option; Gemini's wire is mapped by gemini_native, `max`→`thinkingLevel:high`, while M2.x emits no field) — a single tier rather than an empty list, since an empty list gets backfilled by Codex into a residual "Reasoning / Medium" label (unremovable without CDP), whereas a single max tier with a real default is clean; Grok / moonshot-v1-* keep the default for now.

**Gemini 1M context toggle (provider edit page, off by default) (MOC-241)**: providers that map Gemini (1.5/2.x/3.x) models get an "Enable Gemini 1M context" switch on the edit page. **Off by default** → Gemini's context window is set to 600K (Codex auto-compacts around 480K), keeping it below the long-context threshold where instruction-following noticeably degrades (observed past ~500K); **on** → the full 1M. Gemini only; other providers are unaffected. The toggle writes `context_window` (600000 / 1000000) into the provider's `modelCapabilities`, which the existing highest-priority `explicit_context_window` path consumes directly (`auto_compact_token_limit` = window × 80%).

## Model mapping

Codex App prompts by OpenAI model names; third-party providers use real IDs like `deepseek-v4-pro` / `kimi-k2.7` / `glm-5.2` / `gemini-3-pro`.

This tool maps via `provider.models[slot]` (`gpt-5.5` → `deepseek-v4-pro` etc.); Codex App's model picker shows `<provider> / <real-model>` real names. Upstream `chatcmpl-...` response IDs are auto-rewritten to Codex App-validatable `resp_<base64>`, preserving deployment-affinity encoding so `previous_response_id` is consistent across turns.

**Auto-review model (MOC-173)**: Codex's auto-review (the guardian subagent that risk-approves each tool call) reuses the main conversation model by default, which is slow. The "Auto-review Model" dropdown below "Model Mapping" on the provider config page lets you point it at a separate model — **you can only pick from slots you've already configured** (the dropdown lists only non-empty slots, avoiding duplicate mappings / downgrades). Transfer writes `auto_review_model_override` into the Codex model catalog accordingly, so the review subagent decouples from the main model and reuses the chosen slot's existing mapping (typically a fast / cheap model to speed up approvals); empty = follow the main model. Verified by packet capture on Codex 0.137: once set, the `model` field of review requests switches to the chosen slot, splitting from the main conversation (without changing the main model).

## Development (v2 / Rust)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cmochance/codex-app-transfer.git
cd codex-app-transfer
cargo tauri dev          # launch desktop window with hot-reload
cargo test --workspace --lib   # run unit tests
make mac-app             # local macOS bundle to dist/mac/
```

Fixture reverse-diff (contract tests):

```bash
cargo run --bin xtask -- gen-fixtures
```

Bundling (refer to `.github/workflows/release.yml`):

```bash
cargo tauri build --bundles app,dmg          # macOS arm64
cargo tauri build --bundles nsis,msi         # Windows x64
cargo tauri build --bundles deb,appimage     # Linux x86_64
```

### Pre-push gate (git hook)

The repo ships a local `pre-push` gate (`.githooks/pre-push`) that mirrors CI's `rust-fast-check` lane, catching fmt / compile / unit-test failures locally before you push instead of waiting on CI. Install once per clone:

```bash
scripts/install-hooks.sh        # = git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Each `git push` then runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check` → `cargo check --workspace --exclude codex-app-transfer` → `cargo test --workspace --exclude codex-app-transfer` (`#[ignore]`d network tests stay off, so the gate never hits the network); non-main branches that are behind `origin/main` get a heads-up (so squash-merge isn't blocked by branch protection). Bypass temporarily with `git push --no-verify` (CI still enforces it).

> This gate is the local tier of the "module update auto-check" mechanism (MOC-138): the rest is Dependabot tracking `wreq` and friends, plus a weekly CI canary verifying the Cloudflare bypass still works. Drift detection for the standalone `codex-app-transfer_test` clone lives in `scripts/check-test-repo-drift.sh`.

### Protocol forwarding diagnostics (forward-trace, off by default)

When debugging adapter / protocol-mapping bugs you can enable forward-trace: it writes the **full forwarding cycle** of each request (Codex's original request → what the adapter sends upstream → the upstream reply) as one JSON line per request to `~/.codex-app-transfer/forward-trace/<date>.jsonl`, for offline inspection with `jq`.

```bash
CAS_DIAG_TRACE=1 cargo tauri dev      # or set this env var before launching the packaged app
```

**Off by default**, with zero impact and zero overhead for normal users (without the env var the forwarding path doesn't even clone the request body — just one extra atomic check). Credential-bearing headers and JSON body fields (`authorization` / `api_key` / `*_token`, etc.) are redacted to `***` before being written; but request/response **payloads** (prompts, code, model replies) are written in full — that's required for protocol diagnosis, which is why it's local-only, loopback-only, and off by default, and is never enabled for end users in a release. JSONL field meanings, retention (7 daily files), and redaction boundaries are documented in `crates/proxy/src/diagnostics.rs` (see the `build_forward_trace_value` / `redact_body` / `redact_mcp_value` comments).

Besides the JSONL there's a **live web viewer**. Two ways to enable: ① the env var above; ② the **"Diagnostic mode" toggle on the Settings page** (runtime on/off, no restart). Once on, a read-only SSE web viewer is served on a dedicated port **`http://127.0.0.1:18090`** ("Open viewer" button on Settings opens it), showing forward-trace live plus Codex Desktop's **MCP / OAuth traffic** (captured via an in-page hook from the plugin unlocker; not injected at all while off). Same redaction + loopback-only + off by default. Note: **MCP / OAuth capture requires the plugin-unlocker daemon to be running** ("auto-unlock Codex Plugins" on, Codex launched via this tool with a debug port); otherwise only forward-trace is captured.

The viewer now has six tabs (switch via the "Kind" dropdown): **forward** (protocol-translation traces) / **mcp** (MCP / OAuth traffic) / **cat-webfetch** (built-in web-fetch tool traces, MOC-181) / **chatgpt-backend** (relay-mode diagnostics for Codex account / plugin / remote-control requests passed through to chatgpt.com, MOC-125) / **apply-patch** (decision-chain instrumentation for apply_patch tool-call conversion) / **codex-response** (the response SSE **actually sent back to Codex** after adapter conversion, MOC-194). The cat-webfetch tab shows the full call chain for every `web_fetch` / `web_search` invocation — request parameters → fetch backend + escalation trail → returned result — with expandable detail per record. Records are also machine-readable via `GET http://127.0.0.1:18090/api/traces?kind=cat_webfetch` (or JSONL), so an AI agent can pull them directly for self-diagnosis of web-fetch behavior. The **chatgpt-backend** tab records each passed-through request's inbound/outbound/response with cookie-friendly redaction (keeps cookie names + set-cookie attributes like Domain/Path, masks values), for diagnosing remote-control WebSocket and other session-continuity issues (`kind=chatgpt_backend`). The **apply-patch** tab records, per tool call, the decision chain the adapter (chat / gemini_native) goes through when repacking an upstream `apply_patch` call into a Codex `custom_tool_call` wire — raw function args → extracted + envelope-repaired V4A → JSON/V4A truncation detection + V4A post-hoc syntax validation verdict → completed/incomplete decision, plus a diff of "raw args → extracted V4A" — purpose-built for iterating on the apply_patch module (extract/repair/validate) against real traffic; this tab also records `shell_edit` events where the model uses `exec_command` (shell) to write files directly — `sed -i` / `cat>` / `python` writes / `apply_patch <<EOF` — **bypassing structured apply_patch** (MOC-263 P3, observe-only, zero overhead when off), quantifying how many edits skip apply_patch (`kind=apply_patch`). The **codex-response** tab captures the response SSE bytes after the adapter's `transform_response_stream` conversion, as actually sent back to Codex through the proxy (`kind=codex_response`), for byte-by-byte comparison against forward's upstream raw — verifying each `apply_patch`'s `output_item.added/done`, text/reasoning, etc. are converted and delivered to Codex losslessly.

### Tweaking the UI

The frontend is **Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript** (`frontend/`, fully refactored from the old vanilla-JS + Bootstrap stack). Source lives in `frontend/src/` (SFC single-file components + Pinia + vue-router).

Dev (hot reload):

```bash
cargo tauri dev    # beforeDevCommand spins up vite (localhost:1420) + HMR; editing .vue/.ts auto-refreshes
```

Build: `npm --prefix frontend run build` emits `frontend/dist/`, embedded into the binary via `src-tauri`'s `include_dir!` (prod loads over `cas://localhost/` under a strict CSP `script-src 'self'`). The MacBook-style design system and three themes (light / dark / Chinese-ink) land across the refactor stages.

## Troubleshooting

### Codex models can't run `curl` and similar network commands / approval prompt stuck

`curl` requires elevated permissions. Third-party models currently cannot trigger the macOS escalation prompt, so this app writes `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` + `approval_policy = "never"` into `~/.codex/config.toml` by default on apply. On Windows, or if you have other reasons, you can turn this off in Settings → "Allow Codex network tools (full-access mode)" (#215).

> **⚠️ Security trade-off**: full-access mode lets the model read/write any file and run every command without approval = **fully trust the model** (equivalent to Codex's official "Full access" tier). With the toggle off, Codex falls back to the read-only sandbox + on-request approval. macOS still cannot trigger the elevation prompt, so there is no network access. Provider-native `web_search` is now dropped at the protocol layer (MOC-208); search requests go through the self-built `web_search` / `web_fetch` tools instead (enable the built-in web tools).

### Codex App reports `404 Not Found url: http://127.0.0.1:18080/responses`

Old versions only exposed `/v1/responses`; Codex CLI 0.126+ falls back to `/responses` (without `/v1/`). This tool added the route alias — **v1.0.1 and later all support it** (current v2.x series ships it by default, no extra config needed).

### Codex App reports `stream disconnected before completion`

Usually means `response.id` / `response.model` weren't returned in the shape Codex App expects. This tool rewrites upstream `chatcmpl-...` to `resp_<base64>` while preserving the requested model name — confirm forwarding logs show `resp_...` instead of `chatcmpl-...`.

### Third-party chat reports `idle timeout waiting for websocket` / keeps reconnecting in relay mode

In relay mode (keep the ChatGPT login + route the model to a third party), v2.2.0–v2.2.1 required the model request's ChatGPT JWT to **byte-match** the local `~/.codex/auth.json` before forwarding. Any mismatch (token rotation / a different `CODEX_HOME` / not actually logged into ChatGPT) made the model request return 401 `missing or invalid gateway api key` → Codex's WS hung until the idle timeout → the chat froze (MOC-189 / #427). **Fixed**: the gateway now relies only on localhost binding + the `cas_` fallback, so third-party chat no longer depends on ChatGPT token state. A broken GPT JWT now only affects `/backend-api/*` (plugins/account), not the third-party conversation.

### Upstream 400: `thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing`

Kimi / DeepSeek with thinking enabled require historical assistant messages with `tool_call` to carry `reasoning_content`. This tool **auto-fills a default empty string since v1.0.1** and maps reasoning items from Responses input to the corresponding assistant message.

### Upstream 400: `'reasoning_effort' does not support 'xhigh'`

v2.1.14 and earlier clamped `xhigh` / `max` to `high` for all providers (issue #254). **v2.1.15+ uses a per-provider policy** — DeepSeek truly reaches max; Kimi / GLM / MiMo / MiniMax / Qwen drop the field (upstream doesn't accept it); custom proxies clamp conservatively. See the [reasoning effort mapping table](#reasoning-effort-mapping-chat-compat-reasoning_effort) above for the full matrix.

`auto` / `none` / `disabled` and similar values that Chat endpoints do not accept are always dropped.

### MiniMax 400: `invalid message role: system (2013)`

v2.1.5 and earlier did not convert `role=system` to `role=user`, causing MiniMax `/v1/chat/completions` to 400 the entire request. v2.1.6+ fixes this (closes #139): all `role=system` messages are converted to `role=user` with content prefixed by `[System]\n`.

### MiniMax 400: `invalid function arguments json string` (during autocompact)

During automatic context compaction, the proxy used to truncate oversized tool-call arguments by replacing `function.arguments` with a human-readable "shortened" notice, which violates the OpenAI chat protocol (`arguments` must be a valid JSON string), so strict upstreams like MiniMax returned `400 invalid params, invalid function arguments json string ... (2013)`. Fixed in #356: truncated `arguments` stays a valid JSON object, so compaction saves tokens without breaking the protocol.

### Strict OpenAI-compatible relay gateway (AIOHub, etc.) returns 400: `null is not of type "array"`

Some Codex built-in tools (e.g. `list_mcp_resources` / `load_workspace_dependencies` / `read_thread_terminal` — all-optional or no-parameter tools) omit the `required` array from their parameters schema. Lenient upstreams like OpenAI or DeepSeek treat a missing `required` as an empty set and accept the request; but strict OpenAI-compatible relay gateways (e.g. AIOHub) require every `object` schema to carry an explicit `required` array and return `null is not of type "array"` as a 400, rejecting the entire request. **Fixed in v2.2.2+ (MOC-188)**: the conversion path now fills in `required: []` wherever it is missing from an object schema (semantically neutral — a no-op for lenient upstreams). Routing through such strict gateways no longer fails due to missing schema fields.

### Third-party session switched to GPT reports `Instructions are required`

In a conversation started on a third-party model (e.g. MiniMax / MiMo), sending a message after **switching to real GPT** (`gpt-5.5` etc.) makes the Codex composer show an inline `Instructions are required` error and the conversation stalls. Root cause: Codex **freezes** the model catalog's `base_instructions` field into the session at creation time (never recomputed across resumes); transfer historically wrote an empty string into the catalog, so sessions born on third-party models carried an empty top-level `instructions` forever. Switching to real GPT goes straight to chatgpt.com (bypassing the proxy), and the OpenAI Responses backend hard-requires a non-empty top-level `instructions` → 400. **Fixed (MOC-153)**: transfer now writes a non-empty `base_instructions` into the catalog, so sessions are born compliant and switching to GPT no longer 400s; the sentinel value is precisely stripped from third-party requests by the proxy adapter, leaving third-party conversations byte-identical.

### Third-party session switched to GPT reports `call_id: string too long` or `content: array too long`

Sending a message after **switching a third-party session to real GPT** shows an inline `Invalid 'input[N].call_id': string too long ... maximum length 64` (Gemini-family sessions after tool use) or `Invalid 'input[N].content': array too long ... maximum length 0` (any third-party session with reasoning output). Same root pattern: the OpenAI Responses backend validates the uploaded history item by item, and switching to real GPT goes straight to chatgpt.com (bypassing the proxy, so nothing can be cleaned in flight) — transfer historically encoded the Gemini 3 `thoughtSignature` into call_id (up to several KB, exceeding the 64-char limit), and reasoning items carried a plaintext `content` array (the backend requires it to be empty). **Fixed (MOC-218)**: signatures are now stored in transfer's local cache with call_id kept short, and reasoning items no longer carry `content` / `encrypted_content` fields (thinking display uses the SSE event channel and is unaffected). History produced before the fix cannot be cleaned (same freeze semantics as MOC-153); for old sessions still hitting these errors, start a new conversation.

### Upstream 404 / can't connect (Base URL includes the full endpoint)

Set the provider Base URL to the root or `/v1` only (e.g. `https://api.example.com/v1`); do **not** paste the full endpoint path. The tool appends `/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, or `/responses` per protocol automatically. If the Base URL already ends with one of these (e.g. pasting `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions` verbatim), the path doubles into `…/chat/completions/chat/completions` and the upstream returns 404. Trim the extra endpoint suffix and keep it at `/v1`.

### Codex shows `Failed to revert changes`

This is Codex's own client-side "revert changes" message and does **not** go through this tool's proxy (the revert is performed by Codex against the local file snapshots it maintains, unrelated to the selected model or relay). Common causes: (1) the changed files are locked by an editor / IDE / antivirus, so the rollback can't write on Windows; (2) the files were modified externally after Codex edited them, so the snapshot no longer matches; (3) apply_patch wrote files into a nested subdirectory this session, so Codex can't locate the originals to revert. Close any program holding the files, verify the changes landed in the expected directory, then retry; revert manually if it still fails.

### OpenAI / ChatGPT upstream returns 403 (Cloudflare challenge)

`api.openai.com` / `chatgpt.com` / `help.openai.com` are behind Cloudflare's JS-challenge (TLS fingerprint + JS execution). v2.2.0 and earlier used `reqwest` only, which can't run JS, so requests got 403 / 421 before reaching the origin. From this build the new `crates/http` crate ships a `wreq`-based `ImpersonatingClient::chrome()` that spoofs the Chrome 120 browser fingerprint (TLS client hello + HTTP/2 SETTINGS + headers); curl / headless tiers claim the same version so all three layers present a consistent browser identity (MOC-186); routing is host-based (`should_impersonate` in `crates/http/src/router.rs`). **Call-site migration is staged across subsequent PRs** — until then you may still see 403 from a few outbound paths. Network-gated integration tests in `crates/http/tests/cf_bypass.rs` (run with `cargo test -p codex-app-transfer-http --test cf_bypass -- --include-ignored`) verify `chatgpt.com/` and `help.openai.com/.../codex` return 200 in real conditions.

### Port conflicts

v2 only listens on `18080` (forwarding) by default; the admin UI now uses Tauri in-process `cas://` and no longer occupies 18081. Use `netstat -ano | findstr :18080` to find usage, or change the port in Settings → Port and restart forwarding.

### Windows "unknown publisher" warning

The current Windows build is not Authenticode-signed. The Release page provides `.sha256` and `.sig` to verify the installer hasn't been tampered with.

### Self-host / custom update URL

From v2.1.12+ the client **enforces** RSA-3072 PKCS#1-v1.5-SHA256 verification on `latest.json` and every installer. The upgrade flow fetches `<url>.sig` alongside the file and verifies against the build-time embedded official public key (`release/Codex-App-Transfer-release-public.pem`). Failure is fatal — no SHA256-only fallback.

**A custom update URL must be self-signed to work**:

1. Fork the repo and replace `release/Codex-App-Transfer-release-public.pem` with your own public key.
2. Run `cargo run -p xtask --release -- release-bundle` with the matching private key to sign `latest.json` and every installer.
3. Rebuild the client so the public key is embedded.
4. Users point Settings → Update URL at your `latest.json` endpoint.

Design intent: the client trusts only the build-time embedded public key and never lets a runtime URL replace it, blocking MITM rewrites of `latest.json` (the public PEM lives in `release/` but pulling it from the same origin as the update URL would dissolve the trust anchor).

### Logs

- App UI: real-time panel below the forwarding page, auto-refreshes every 2s
- Disk: `~/.codex-app-transfer/logs/proxy-YYYY-MM-DD.log` — click "View Logs" to open directly
- "Clear logs" moves the current log to `logs/backup/` with a timestamp suffix — never deletes outright

## Tech Stack

- **Backend / forwarding**: Rust 1.85+ · axum 0.8 · reqwest 0.12 (rustls-tls) · tokio · `wreq` 6.0-rc (browser TLS fingerprint impersonation, Chrome 120 fingerprint; curl / wreq / headless all claim the same version to avoid cross-layer identity drift; for Cloudflare-strict `openai.com` / `chatgpt.com`; see `crates/http/`) · `sys-locale` (reads system locale to emit a locale-aware `Accept-Language`, reducing UA-blocklist false positives) · `base64` (Bing `ck/a` redirect decoding) · `chromiumoxide` 0.9 (headless Chromium to fetch JS-rendered SPAs that ①reqwest / ②wreq can't reach — detects system Chrome, else downloads chrome-headless-shell on demand to app data, not bundled; PoC for now, router integration in a later PR; see `crates/http/src/headless/`) · `crates/http::web_fetch` (unified fetch layer routing curl/wreq/headless by the settings tier; paired with `GET /api/chrome/ready` (readiness gate) + `POST /api/chrome/ensure`; when `webFetchBackend != off`, automatically registers `[mcp_servers.cat-webfetch]` in `~/.codex/config.toml` — a stdio MCP server (transfer binary + `--mcp-serve-webfetch`) — exposing the `web_fetch` and `web_search` tools to the Codex model)
- **Protocol adapters**: `crates/adapters/` — Responses ↔ Chat / Gemini Native / Gemini CLI OAuth / Anthropic Messages / Grok Web (request body + streaming response state machine + reasoning_content + tool_calls)
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript (SFC + Pinia + vue-router; source `frontend/src/`, `frontend/dist` embedded into the binary via `include_dir!`, prod served over `cas://localhost/` under strict CSP `script-src 'self'`; MacBook-style design + three themes: light / dark / inkwash)
- **Desktop shell**: Tauri 2 + tray-icon 0.23; the `cas://` URI scheme glues frontend/ and axum in-process, no TCP loopback
- **Storage**: `~/.codex-app-transfer/config.json` (config, compatible with v1.x), `~/.codex-app-transfer/sessions.db` (L2 sqlite session persistence), `~/.codex-app-transfer/blobs/` (large in-conversation images, sha256-deduplicated out of the db; not auto-removed when you delete the db — delete it too, or use Settings → Advanced → Session history → "Clear session history", which moves all Codex conversation rollouts to the trash (recoverable) and clears this L2 cache), `~/.codex/{config.toml,auth.json,.credentials.json}` (Codex App integration), `~/.codex-app-transfer/mcp-credentials.json` (MCP credential mirror, outside `~/.codex`)
- **Packaging**: `cargo tauri build` single command produces dmg/AppImage/deb/exe/msi; `xtask release-bundle` finalizes sha256 + RSA-3072 sig + latest.json + draft GitHub release

## Disclaimer

This project focuses on **OpenAI Codex App** integration; it is **not** an official OpenAI / Anthropic / Google / xAI project and does not reuse their trademarks / logos / release identities.

Upstream API keys / OAuth tokens are stored locally in `~/.codex-app-transfer/` (Unix 0600 + atomic write); the forwarding service only listens on `127.0.0.1` and does not hijack the system proxy. Apart from the feedback feature, this tool performs no third-party network access.

Some experimental providers (Grok Web / Gemini CLI OAuth / Antigravity OAuth) involve upstream TOS gray areas — Grok Web reverse-proxies grok.com's Web backend, Gemini CLI OAuth uses the undocumented internal endpoint `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal` — strictly limited to **personal use**, **must not** be deployed as a public service, **carries a real account-ban risk**, **users assume the risk**. These gray-area providers are **hidden by default** in the "Add provider" list; enable the **Show gray-area providers** setting to reveal them (MOC-91).
